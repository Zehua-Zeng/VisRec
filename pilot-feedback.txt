to be fixed:
Tutorial Video is too quick
Some missing interaction logs: (i) hover on charts; (ii) scroll up/down; (iii) record the time when hitting submit button
put a timer on Task 4?

fixed:
Answer - change from typing in to dropdown selecting or radio selecting
In post-task questions, change "recommended charts" to "related views"
